Reflection:
For this project, I created a personal website to highlight my abilities as a web developer. I included my resume and picture to provide visitors with more information about me. Here's what I did in each file:

HTML:
- Created the structure of the website using semantic HTML5 elements.
- Designed different sections such as About Me, Education, and Contact using appropriate HTML tags.
- Included a Contact Me form with input fields for name, email, address, city, postal code, message, and reason for contact.

CSS:
- Styled the website to improve its visual appeal and readability.
- Used CSS to center the content in the viewport and ensure equal margins on both sides.
- Applied responsive design techniques to make the website adaptable to different screen sizes.

JavaScript:
- Implemented functionality to dynamically reveal an input box for hourly rate when the user selects "Hiring" in the Contact Me form.

Overall, I aimed to create a clean and user-friendly website that effectively showcases my skills and experiences as a web developer.
