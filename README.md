    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    <p>
        For this project, I created a personal website to highlight my abilities as a web developer. I included my resume and picture to provide visitors with more information about me. Here's what I did in each file:
    </p>

    <h3>HTML:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Created the structure of the website using semantic HTML5 elements.</li>
        <li>Designed different sections such as About Me, Education, and Contact using appropriate HTML tags.</li>
        <li>Included a Contact Me form with input fields for name, email, address, city, postal code, message, and reason for contact.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>CSS:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Styled the website to improve its visual appeal and readability.</li>
        <li>Used CSS to center the content in the viewport and ensure equal margins on both sides.</li>
        <li>Applied responsive design techniques to make the website adaptable to different screen sizes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>JavaScript:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implemented functionality to dynamically reveal an input box for hourly rate when the user selects "Hiring" in the Contact Me form.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Overall, I aimed to create a clean and user-friendly website that effectively showcases my skills and experiences as a web developer.</p>
